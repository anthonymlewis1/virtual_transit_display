### Steps Remaining (Listed in order of necessary completion):
- [ ] Create generalized crawler for PATH train schedules leaving from generic destinations
- [ ] Create generalized data loader for handling config creation for Front End
- [ ] Create scheduler function for executing scraping 
- [ ] Create CI process for updating app 
- [ ] Get Python scraper dependencies to install with Front End dependencies [(via npm install)](https://github.com/baspete/Split-Flap#installation)  
- [ ] Integrate new images into rows (to take place of [airlines](https://github.com/baspete/Split-Flap/tree/master/public/plugins/arrivals))
- [ ] Customize display dimensions/colors
